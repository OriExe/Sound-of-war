An fps game I made with my team at the University of Westminster.
It's a first person shooter inspired by cod zombies where you kill tons of enemies to progress through rounds and fight harder enemies that spawn in higher frequency. 
You have a limited amount of ammo so make your shots count

If you find your weapons aren't doing enough damage or are running low on ammo then you can pick up new and exciting weapons from the ground that are dropped by the enemies you kill. 

The pistol has more ammo then the other weapons but is single fire only and does less damage as rounds progress

The SMG is a fast firing weapon but has high recoil and you may end up running out of ammo faster then you expected

The AR fires slower then the SMG but is easier to control and does more damage
